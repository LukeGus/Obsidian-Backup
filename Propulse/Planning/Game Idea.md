The plan is to create a drone minigame based game where you join a lobby and you play different minigame's. If you win a minigame you get money to upgrade your drone. Drones have customizable components, such as propulsion systems, sensors, and weaponry, which players can enhance to gain advantages in different minigames. Players must adapt their drone's setup to the upcoming minigame, adjusting their components to best suit the challenge. In addition to functional upgrades, players can also unlock cosmetic upgrades to personalize the appearance of their drones.
