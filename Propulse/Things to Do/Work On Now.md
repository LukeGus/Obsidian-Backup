The Game Idea

A  racing game with many different maps. You can buy uprades for what we have. Come up with something different for angle lock or just lower the lock value. Have a weapon that slows down the player, remove weapons  and only use abilities. Have a ability that temporairly increases speed, temporarily increases gyro speed, temporarily makes you smaller, and temporarily weigh less.
