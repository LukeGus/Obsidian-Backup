Use remote config for prices, how much money players get for things, maps that are allowed, that kind of thing.

Will have to use loot locker to save drone setups

Figure out player names. I can always login and start a session, but disallow anything else before the Playername isnt null. To figure out what is null use a debug to figure out what the name is before setting a name.;

For the loadout. Have a template script that has a function that buys the upgrade, a function that equipts the upgrade, and a function that modifys the drone for that equiptment if it is equipted.

Have a script that just deals with setting the currency text
Have a script that creates every key.
