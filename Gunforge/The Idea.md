Services: Dedicated Servers

The general idea is to create a multiplayer fps game. The game will offer many many many many game modes including your typical team deathmatch but also a battle royal. The game will be run across dedicated servers. You will be able to customize your gun with attachments and buy new ones for each game mode you can use different guns and loadouts for each class. In the battle royal you just find weapons. You can unlock skins and stuff and buy upgrades and stuff with irl money from the website or in game money you get by winning and playing and such. There will be animations and nice maps that periodically change from server to server. The game will have a launcher that auto updates from a Ci/CD pipeline. The game will be on windows, linux, osx, and maybe webgl if it runs (Or if there are other webgl alternatives). The movement will be slighly parkour like with slight wall run and ledge grab but it will not be completely focused on that. I want the physics to be realistic with wallbanging and such.  Along with particle effects and nice sound effects. The servers will open when needed using maybe a EC2 style thingamabob.
